						During my time in <abbr title="Virtual Reality Development">VRD</abbr> 144 at Cochise College, I created a fully
						physics-based player rig for <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> games. The rig integrated physically-based
						climbing, grabbing, and movement, creating emergent and intuitive game mechanics from simple behavior.
						These mechanics included functional ice climbing using ice axes, sliding down a zipline with a crowbar,
						and climbing a radio broadcast tower in <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>.

						Compensation Social was a live-service multiplayer <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> game I developed

						developed the <abbr title="User-Generated Content">UGC</abbr> creation tools of the game, which were -at the time-
						entirely unmatched on standalone <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>. At its peak, Compensation amassed over
						200 registered users.
